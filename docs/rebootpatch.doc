What IS rebootpatch?
--------------------

Rebootpatch is a very simple patch which opens a requester if a program attempts
to reboot your system, for example the end of a software installation. The
requester lets you choose whether you want to deny the reboot or allow it. The
requester also tries to tell you the name of the Task which is requesting the
reboot. If processes request a reboot then it may just read something like
'Shell Process' or 'Background CLI' instead. You can of course leave the
requester open until you decide to reboot. The calling program will however be
blocked from further execution until the requeter is answered.

What ISN'T rebootpatch?
-----------------------

Rebootpatch isn't a snowman, a weapon of mass destruction or a laxative. Infact,
rebootpatch isn't lots of things, but in particular it doesn't prevent HARDWARE
RESETS. For example, resets generated by the keyboard or a reset button. It also
will not prevent your machine from resetting if a program goes bat-shit and
crashes.

Installation
------------

Copy rebootpatch wherever you like, but C: is probably an appropriate location.
Rebootpatch currently does not detach itself from the CLI, so the following
should be added to your s:user-startup (or s:startup-sequence if you prefer)

run c:rebootpatch <>NIL:

Once the patch is running, you can test to see if it works by running the
supplied 'reboot' program. If the patch is installed, a requester will open
which will warn you of the 'reboot request'. If the patch is NOT installed,
then, erm.... your system will reboot :-) You can quit rebootpatch by sending it
a CTRL + C signal or by listing your processes with "status" and using "break"
to send a signal to the rebootpatch process.

IMPORTANT
---------

Rebootpatch patches the OS function Coldreboot(). This function is never
expected to return by the calling program, because it's expected that your
system will reboot. If you deny a reboot then the calling program will enter a
state of unknown execution because Coldreboot() WILL return. I haven't found
this to be a problem, everything seems to continue as normal, probably because
most programs don't write extra code after calling Coldreboot() (for obvious
reaons), but the potential is there for the program to misbehave and you should
be aware of this.


DISCLAIMER
----------

Use or misuse of the program rebootpatch either directly, or indirectly is
entirely at the user's risk, without exception. The user accepts in full all
consequences which arise from it's use, including, but not limited to, damage to
hardware, software, loss of earnings and all legal consequences, both civil and
criminal.
